# Choose Your Own Adventure - EMP

EMP Survival is a single player choose your own adventure game. 

You choose between two characters thrown out of their everyday lives into an apocalypse scenario when an EMP hits their city. 

The goal of Level 1 is to get out of downtown and get home. 

Every choice you make will either take you closer to your goal or cause you to lose the game.

### Instructions:
Before you start your game decide whether or not you want to play as a prepper (with extra supplies) or as a couch potato who is totally unprepared for the apocalypse. 

If you choose a bad path you have the option to go back a step and choose again.

Good luck!

## Next Steps and Future Enhancements 

The next iteration of the game will include: 
* Level 2
* A system of health points: Certain decisions will give or take health points. If your health points reach zero the game will end regardless of whether or not that decision is a hard coded loss.
* Opportunities to pick up new supplies which could come into play in future scenarios 

Further in the future: 
* Look for more in depth options for character customization along with a look into their backstories.
